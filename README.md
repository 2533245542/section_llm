This repository includes a self-contained script for an example of creating the inputs to the LLM server (vllm), and postprocessing the outputs of the LLM.

We used vllm for querying LLMs, which is convinient since it automatically handles the LLM input templates (https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)

We used the Platypus repository for fine-tuning LLMs (https://github.com/arielnlee/Platypus).
